        Hello, and welcome to my space! I’m Esther Adeola, a passionate lifelong
        learner, transitioning from a rewarding career in nursing to the
        ever-evolving tech industry. As a single mother of 4 amazing kids, I've
        mastered the art of multitasking, nurturing with patience, and tackling
        challenges with resilience and grace.
      </p>

      <p>
        My Journey from Nursing to Tech My journey into the realm of technology
        began out of a combination of curiosity, necessity, and the desire for a
        new challenge. Having spent 13years in nursing, I've had the privilege
        of making a difference in countless lives, providing care, empathy, and
        support to those in need. My experience in the healthcare sector has
        honed my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to
        thrive under pressure—qualities that I discovered are just as crucial in
        the tech world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision to transition into tech was sparked by the increasing role
        of technology in healthcare. Fascinated by the potential of tech to
        transform lives, I embarked on this new journey, fuelled by the same
        passion and dedication that guided me in my nursing career.
      </p>
      <h2>Embracing the Challenge: Learning and Growing:</h2>
      <p>
        Balancing my responsibilities as a single mother while diving into the
        depths of coding, UX design and general software development has been
        nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. Yet, it's a challenge I embrace
        wholeheartedly. Each late-night study session, every line of code, and
        all the moments in between have been steps toward not just a career
        change, but a life transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been fortunate to learn from incredible mentors and supportive
        communities, both in nursing and tech, who have taught me the importance
        of empathy, continuous learning, and giving back. As I navigate this
        transition, I'm eager to blend my healthcare background with new tech
        skills to innovate and make a meaningful impact.
      </p>
      
       <h2> Looking Ahead: My Vision for the Future </h2>
        <p>As I continue on this exciting
        journey, my goal is to leverage technology to improve healthcare
        outcomes, and develop accessible tech solutions for underserved
        communities. I believe that my unique perspective, combining hands-on
        healthcare experience with tech skills, will allow me to contribute to
        projects and initiatives that truly make a difference.
